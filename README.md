An Example Backbone/jQuery Project
==================================


This is an example JavaScript project made using Backbone.js, jQuery,
and QUnit. We implement a simple incrementing counter. Here are some
places to start:

 * src/my_code.js -- the code under test, the counter Model and View
 * tests/test_my_code.js -- the tests for my_code.js
 * tests/index.html -- the test runner. Open in a browser to run
   the tests
